# welcome to this sorry attempt at social climbing
Clone the repo and view the code from your own development environments. All the practice*.sql scripts do not write into the database (except for practice1.sql), this so that you can source them multiple times. The insert into the database exercise items are left as an exercise to whoever the fuck is viewing this repo.

# Interesting items...
- sql hoa number 6 (added wrong right version)
  - the logical way of doing the query doesn't give the exact match to expected output, hardcode 18 to get exact match
